Repository Overview

This repository contains two projects developed during my MSc Economics programme:

1. COMPUTATIONALMACRO.py
   
Coursework: Final assignment for Computational Macroeconomics.

Focus: Numerical solution of a New Keynesian framework under adaptive learning.

Methods: Linear Time Iteration (LTI) to solve equilibrium dynamics and simulate model responses.


2. MIGRATIONCORRUPTION.R
   
Project: Seminar paper “Migration and Corruption: A Dynamic Analysis of Institutional Change in Origin Countries”.

Focus: Empirical assessment of the impact of emigration on corruption in developing and post-communist countries.

METHODS:

Data cleaning and panel dataset construction (1990–2010).

Instrumental variables based on geographical proximity and gravity-predicted migration.

Dynamic panel estimation using System GMM (Blundell–Bond).

Robustness checks across skill levels, income groups, and interaction effects.


REQUIREMENTS:

Python (with numpy, scipy, matplotlib) for COMPUTATIONALMACRO.py.

R (with plm, ivreg, pdynmc, AER, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2) for MIGRATIONCORRUPTION.R.



USAGE

Run COMPUTATIONALMACRO.py to simulate the New Keynesian model.

Run MIGRATIONCORRUPTION.R in RStudio or via command line after loading the relevant datasets.



Data Availability
Unfortunately, the datasets used in MIGRATIONCORRUPTION.R cannot be publicly shared due to access restrictions.
